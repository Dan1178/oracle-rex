    This game is the 4th edition with Prophecy of Kings expansion, and may include Discordant Stars factions.

1. Suggest a high-level game strategy for the player, considering all factors including but not limited to: board layout, position, and neighbors.
2. Provide early game advice â€” such as which planets to prioritize and key threats to watch for.
3. Provide a first-round plan, including which units to move where and in what order, what to build, etc.
Be reasonably concise and tactical. Avoid obvious advice such as 'secure home adjacent systems' unless you have a specific or unusual strategy for doing so.
